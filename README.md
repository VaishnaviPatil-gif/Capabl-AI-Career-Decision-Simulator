# Capabl — AI Career Decision Simulator

Capabl is an AI-powered career decision platform for students. Instead of just telling a student **“learn React”** or dumping a huge skill checklist, Capabl turns their **real evidence** — resume, projects, certifications, and mock interview performance — into an **evidence-based readiness score**, then simulates multiple learning paths with explicit tradeoffs so the student can decide what to do next.

> **You decide; the AI never picks for you.**

---

## 📌 Problem

Students trying to become **Full Stack Developers, AI Engineers, Data Engineers, and other roles** often get stuck on one question:

> **“What should I actually learn next to get hired?”**

The problem is not lack of information — it’s too much of it.

Existing tools often:

* oversimplify the answer into generic advice
* overwhelm users with long skill lists
* fail to explain **tradeoffs**
* give “scores” without showing **where the number came from**

Capabl was built to solve that gap.

---

## ✨ What Capabl does

Capabl helps a student go from **confusion → clarity → action**.

### 1) Resume & Evidence Analysis

Capabl takes a student’s real evidence:

* Resume (PDF)
* Projects
* Certifications
* Mock interview performance
* Optional GitHub / LinkedIn context

and uses it to build a more honest picture of their readiness.

### 2) Role Skill Intelligence

Given a target role (for example **Full Stack Developer**), Capabl identifies the **skills that role demands today** and assigns importance weights.

### 3) Evidence-Based Readiness Scoring

Capabl does **not** let the LLM invent a score.
Instead, it computes readiness from a fixed, auditable formula across multiple evidence sources.

### 4) Decision Simulator / What-If Analysis

Capabl generates **three distinct paths** such as:

* **Quick Wins**
* **Close Critical Gaps**
* **Balanced Sprint**

Each path shows:

* projected readiness gain
* estimated effort
* the skills it focuses on
* **the tradeoff** (what you are delaying by choosing it)

### 5) AI Mock Interview + Scorecard

Students can take a mock interview through Capabl’s voice interview flow and receive:

* an interview scorecard
* dimension-level feedback
* strengths and areas to improve
* concrete next steps before the next interview

### 6) Roadmap & Action Plan

Once the student chooses a path, Capabl can turn it into a structured next-step learning plan.

# 🧠 Core Idea

Capabl is designed around one decision moment:

> **“Given my real evidence, which learning path should I commit to this month — and what am I giving up by choosing it?”**

The AI helps the student **reason**, but the final decision remains with the student.

---

# 🏗️ How it works

## Step 1 — Inputs

Capabl takes:

* target role
* resume
* projects
* certifications
* interview transcript / interview performance
* optional GitHub/LinkedIn context

## Step 2 — AI + Scoring Pipeline

Capabl uses AI where **meaning** matters and deterministic rules where **trust** matters.

### AI is used for:

* parsing the target role
* understanding resume/project language
* inferring role skills
* semantic matching between evidence and skills
* generating explanations / plan text

### Deterministic logic is used for:

* readiness scoring
* projected score gains
* path comparison logic
* confidence bands
* evidence breakdowns

# 📊 Readiness Scoring Philosophy

Capabl deliberately avoids “mystery scores.”

Instead of asking an LLM to output a readiness number, Capabl computes scores from evidence sources such as:

* interview
* projects
* resume
* certifications
* roadmap progress

This makes the score:

* more reproducible
* easier to audit
* easier to explain to the user

---

# 🧩 Key Features

## 1. Career Readiness Dashboard

A dashboard that surfaces:

* overall readiness
* role match
* skill readiness
* confidence band / uncertainty
* evidence-backed skill analysis

## 2. Decision Simulator

Capabl’s signature feature.
Instead of giving one answer, it shows multiple strategies side-by-side so the student can compare:

* short-term wins
* critical missing skills
* balanced progress

## 3. AI Voice Mock Interview

Capabl includes a voice interview flow that helps students practice role-specific questions and get structured feedback.

## 4. Resume Analysis

Capabl parses the student’s resume and uses it as a key evidence source in the readiness pipeline.

## 5. Project Intelligence

Projects are not just listed — they are treated as evidence for specific skills and readiness signals.

## 6. Roadmap / Learning Progress

Capabl can turn selected paths into actionable learning steps and track progress.

# ⚙️ Local Setup

## 1) Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VaishnaviPatil-gif/Capabl-AI-Career-Decision-Simulator.git
cd Capabl-AI-Career-Decision-Simulator
```

---

## 2) Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in `backend/` and add the required environment variables.

Example:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=5000

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

RETELL_API_KEY=your_retell_api_key
RETELL_AGENT_ID=your_retell_agent_id
RETELL_AGENT_NAME=your_retell_agent_name

GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Then push the Prisma schema and start the backend:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npx tsx src/server.ts
```

# 🧪 Example User Flow

1. Student signs up and chooses a target role
2. Uploads resume and adds projects/certifications
3. Capabl analyzes evidence and computes readiness
4. Student views dashboard and skill breakdown
5. Student opens **Decision Simulator** to compare multiple learning paths
6. Student chooses a path and continues with a roadmap / interview preparation flow

---

# 🎯 Why Capabl is different

Most career tools either:

* generate a generic roadmap
* give a score with no explanation
* or recommend one “best” next step

Capabl is different because it focuses on **decision-making under uncertainty**.

It does **three important things**:

1. **grounds the score in evidence**
2. **shows tradeoffs between multiple paths**
3. **keeps the human in control**

Capabl is not trying to replace judgment.
It is trying to help a student make a better one.

---

# ⚠️ Current limitations / future work

Capabl is still evolving. Some future improvements include:

* broader role coverage
* stronger resume extraction / OCR fallback for difficult PDFs
* more robust interview analytics
* longer 30/60/90-day plans
* repeated simulation as the student’s evidence grows
* stronger recruiter-facing profile insights

## Final note

Capabl is built around a simple belief:

> Students don’t just need more advice.
> They need help making better career decisions from the evidence they already have.
